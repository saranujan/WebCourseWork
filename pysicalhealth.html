            <h1 class="heading1">What is Physical Health?</h1>
            <p class="paragraph">Physical health encompasses a multitude of interconnected factors vital for the optimal functioning of the body. At its core lies regular physical activity, which not only strengthens muscles and bones but also bolsters cardiovascular health, enhances flexibility, and aids in weight management. Moreover, exercise acts as a potent mood booster, alleviating symptoms of anxiety and depression while fostering a sense of well-being. Complementing physical activity, a balanced diet rich in nutrients serves as the fuel for the body's intricate machinery. Fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats provide the essential vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants necessary for cellular function, metabolism, and immune response. Adequate rest and quality sleep are equally imperative, as they facilitate tissue repair, hormone regulation, and cognitive processing. Hydration, often overlooked, is fundamental for maintaining proper bodily functions, regulating temperature, and supporting nutrient transport. Regular medical check-ups and screenings serve as preventive measures, allowing for early detection and intervention of potential health concerns. Additionally, effective stress management techniques such as mindfulness, deep breathing exercises, and engaging in hobbies can mitigate the detrimental effects of chronic stress on physical health. By integrating these components into daily life, individuals can cultivate resilience, vitality, and longevity, ultimately leading to a more fulfilling and balanced existence. Physical health serves as the cornerstone upon which one can build a life characterized by vitality, resilience, and overall well-being, underscoring its paramount importance in the pursuit of a fulfilling and meaningful existence.</p>

            <p class="paragraph">Physical health, also known as physical wellness, is more than just how fit you are. Physical health is how well your organs and body systems function. 

                Each personâ€™s version of physical health is different. Someone can achieve their own definition of physical health, despite a disease, a disability, or their age.
                
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph"> Physical health is a fundamental aspect of overall well-being, encompassing the proper functioning of body systems and senses. It is characterized by indicators such as regular heart rate, clear vision, balanced movement, and the absence of cavities. However, achieving and maintaining physical health is influenced by various factors, including lifestyle choices, biology, environment, access to healthcare, and health education. While some factors, such as genetics, are beyond our control, many others, such as diet, substance use, sleep, physical activity, and stress management, are within our power to influence. Making informed decisions in these areas can significantly impact our physical health and quality of life.                
                    Physical health is often assessed through the functioning of body systems and senses. Examples include having no cavities in teeth, maintaining a regular heart rate, clear vision with or without glasses, and feeling balanced while moving. These indicators reflect the efficiency and effectiveness of bodily processes, from circulation and digestion to sensory perception and motor coordination. Maintaining optimal physical health requires attention to lifestyle choices, environmental factors, access to healthcare, and health education. By addressing these aspects comprehensively, individuals can enhance their overall well-being and resilience against illness and disease.
                    
                    In the following sections, we will explore in detail the various factors that impact physical health, including lifestyle choices, biology, environment, access to healthcare, and health education. Understanding how these factors intersect and influence one another is essential for promoting and maintaining optimal physical health throughout the lifespan.</p>

                    <img  class="img"    src="/Student 03/Pictures/physicalhealth3.jpeg" alt="physicalhealth3">
                    <p class="paragraph">Generally, we have a lot of control over our physical health. 
                        One of the most significant impacts is our lifestyle choices.</p><br>
                        <h4>Diet</h4>
                        <p class="paragraph">Our diets influence our physical health. We should focus on eating regular meals made of nutrient-dense foods. Nutrient-dense foods have lots of vitamins, minerals, and nutrients and not too much sugar, sodium, or saturated fats. 

                            We don't always have access to the foods we want. If you need help getting enough food, visit FeedingAmerica.org to find a food bank in your community.
                            
                            If you have food aversions or are a caregiver for someone with food aversions, a speech therapist may be able to help.</p>
                            <h4>Substance Use</h4>
                            <p class="paragraph ">
                                Substances like tobacco, alcohol, drugs, and prescription medications affect the body's systems.

                                Prescription medications can support physical health when used correctly under a doctor's supervision.

                            </p>
                            <h4>Sleep</h4>
                            <p class="paragraph">Sleep helps our bodies and brain recover. Rest gives us the energy to be more physically active too.

                            </p>

                            <p class="paragraph">
                                Physical activity is good for your bones, muscles, and heart. The CDC has guidelines on how much physical activity we need each day. 

    Staying active can look different for everyone. If you are an individual with a disability or a caregiver for an individual with a disability, a physical therapist or a recreational therapist may be able to help.
                            </p>
                            <h4>Stress Management</h4>
                            <p class="paragraph">Stress is a part of life, but too much stress for too long affects our physical health. We canâ€™t always control if we experience stress, but we can find healthy ways to handle it. Stress management can include:

                    <h3>#2 Biology</h3>
                    <p class="paragraph">Our genetics play a role in our physical health too. Since we inherit our genes from our parents, we don't get to choose our biology.

                        Fortunately, lifestyle choices play a major role in our physical health. By making healthy choices for our bodies, we can still reach our personal goals for physical health.
                        
                        A disease, genetic disorder, or disability does not mean someone canâ€™t be physically healthy. They may need to work with doctors or specialists to help t</p>

                    <h3>#3 Environment
                    </h3>
                    <p class="paragraph">Pollution in the air, water, or soil is harmful to physical health. There can also be dangerous substances in food, consumer products, and building materials. 

                        Mold in your home can cause respiratory problems. Contaminated drinking water can cause digestive issues. If you have unexplained illnesses, you should contact a doctor.
                        
                        Talk to your local health department if you have concerns about an environmental issue in your home or community.</p>
                </div>

                <div><h3>#4 Access to Healthcare</h3>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    Regular visits to a doctor, dentist, and other medical professionals are important for your physical health. Routine check-ups help us find health problems early. If you have any physical health concerns, you need a doctor to treat you.

    Unfortunately, not everyone can easily visit or afford a doctor. Not having access to quality healthcare leads to more health inequity. Health inequity is when some groups have worse health because of unfair treatment. 

    If parents experience health inequity, their childrenâ€™s health can be affected too. This includes access to prenatal care during pregnancy.

                    <h3>#5 Health Education</h3>
                    <p class="paragraph">Caring for our physical health starts with education. Children need to learn about caring for their health starting in early childhood. Health education gives students the information they need to make healthy decisions.</p>
